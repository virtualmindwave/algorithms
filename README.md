My journey in learning algorithms using Java

### Dynamic Connectivity
1. Quick Find - (Cons) slow on large data sets due to number of array accesses specially the union method. Number of array accesses is quadratic.
2. Quick Union - Tree structure interpretation. Still slow on large data sets as the Tree grows tall. Number of array accesses is linear.

#### Learning in progress..
